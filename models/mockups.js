The harbor offers amazing views and a maze of wharves and canals, along with towering spires make for a beautiful sight. Take a stroll and duck into one of the pubs or eateries along the way.<br><br>Only three pre World War II buildings in the city centre have survived and are worth a look - city hall, St. Laurence church and the White House. Explore the Museum Boymans van Beuningen, which houses a unique collection dating from the 14th century, or the Museum Voor Volkenkunde - home to ethnological exhibits. Exquisite architecture can be seen in many areas of Rotterdam, most notably in the Delfshaven quarter of the city - where 18th century houses are on display.

            "Sitting by a natural harbor at the mouth of the Penfeld River in western Brittany, the city of Brest has a rich maritime history that stretches from the Middle Ages to today, as it is home to the main French naval base in the Atlantic. Brest’s strategic importance was first established in the 1600s, when Cardinal Richelieu created a naval base and arsenal here. Throughout the Napoleonic Wars, warships were produced in its dockyards. During World War I, Americans maintained a naval air station in Brest, then Germany took control of the city during World War II and stationed U-boat submarines in its harbor. Though much of the city was destroyed in 1944 after an Allied invasion, one of Brest’s most important sites escaped the bombing: the Château de Brest, a 13th-century castle that’s the oldest structure in town. Just across the Penfeld River stands the 14th-century tower Tour Tanguy; inside is a museum that showcases the history of the city prior to World War II, with dioramas, photographs, postcards and other objects.",

            "Holland America Line was founded in 1873 as the Netherlands-America Steamship Company (NASM), a shipping and passenger line. Because it was headquartered in Rotterdam and provided service to the Americas, it became known as Holland America Line. The company's first ocean liner was the Rotterdam, which sailed its maiden voyage from the Netherlands to New York City on Oct. 15, 1872. The one-way voyage took 15 days. Following that first voyage, Holland America Line has seen a series of benchmark moments in its history.\r\n\r\nBy its 25th anniversary, Holland America Line owned a fleet of six cargo and passenger ships, and also provided service between Holland and the Dutch East Indies via the newly constructed Suez Canal. \r\nThe line was a principal carrier of immigrants from Europe to the United States until well after the turn of the century, carrying 850,000 to new lives in the New World. \r\nIn 1895, the company offered its first vacation cruise; its second leisure cruise, from New York to the Holy Land, was in 1910. \r\nIn 1971, Holland America Line suspended its transatlantic passenger trade and turned to offering cruise vacations full time. \r\nIn 1989, Holland America Line Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Carnival Corp., the largest cruise company in the world.

        "In honor of some of the most memorable ships in Holland America Line's history, our third Pinnacle-class ship (and new flagship) will be named Rotterdam. This new addition to our fleet will fill your journey with a rhythm all its own, putting music front and center, creating the soundtrack to the discoveries you make every day. At the heart of it all is Music Walk: an exclusive collection of five venues featuring live music and electrifying performances from accomplished musicians, dancers and artists every night. Rotterdam hits all the right notes: exquisite dining experiences, enhanced staterooms and suites, the finest service at sea and craftsmanship that reflects nearly 150 years of seafaring expertise. The result is a ship that moves you — from the start of your first day to the end of each perfect night.",

      shortdescription:
        "In honor of some of the most memorable ships in Holland America Line's history, our third Pinnacle-class ship (and new flagship) will be named Rotterdam. This new addition to our fleet will fill your journey with a rhythm all its own, putting music front and center, creating the soundtrack to the discoveries you make every day. At the heart of it all is Music Walk: an exclusive collection of five venues featuring live music and electrifying performances from accomplished musicians, dancers and artists every night. Rotterdam hits all the right notes: exquisite dining experiences, enhanced staterooms and suites, the finest service at sea and craftsmanship that reflects nearly 150 years of seafaring expertise. The result is a ship that moves you — from the start of your first day to the end of each perfect night.",
